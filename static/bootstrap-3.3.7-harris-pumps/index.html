        You will need to have your water tested by a laboratory. Depending on what you are testing for you may need a sterile container.<br />
        Drop your water sample into our shop, we can arrange to have it tested and run through the results with you, or alternatively you can drop it into a local laboratory.

        Hawke's Bay has notoriously hard water. It is quite common in many homes to have lime deposits on taps, in the kettle, and in electric hot water cylinders. While hard water can be safe to drink, it causes problems such as the premature failure of hot water elements and blocks taps. The presence of harmful bacteria, or heavy metals, is dangerous to your health. They are difficult to detect without getting a water test. The most common indication of bad water is sickness in the household. If your water tastes or smells unusual, or you have staining in any area water is used, we strongly recommend an immediate water test.
